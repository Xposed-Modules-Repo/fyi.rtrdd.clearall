An Xposed module that puts an always-visible **Clear all** button in the Pixel Launcher's
Overview screen.

The launcher already has one — `RecentsView` adds `ClearAllButton` as the *last page* of
the recents pager, so reaching it means scrolling past every task. This module adds a
second one that is on screen the moment Overview opens.

It does that one thing and nothing else, so it will not collide with launcher or system-UI
tweaks your ROM already applies.

## Where the button goes

It places itself differently depending on the panel, chosen from the screen configuration
(`smallestScreenWidthDp`), which is the same signal the launcher's own `updateForIsTablet()`
uses:

| Panel | Placement |
|---|---|
| Phones, and a foldable's cover screen | Inside the existing Screenshot / Select row |
| Tablets, and a foldable unfolded | Floating beside the task carousel |

On compact panels it becomes a real child of the `action_buttons` `LinearLayout`, so the
row re-measures and **all the buttons re-centre together**. It copies its appearance —
background drawable, text colour, typeface, padding, metrics — from whichever stock button
it ends up beside, rather than approximating a style, and draws a matching leading icon
sized from its neighbour's.

On large screens it aligns its centre to the stock `ClearAllButton` in screen coordinates
and mirrors `RecentsView`'s content alpha, so it fades in and out with Overview.

## When it is visible

Only when Overview is genuinely open and has tasks:

- hidden while a swipe gesture is in progress (`onGestureAnimationStart` / `End`)
- hidden unless `RecentsView` is at scale ~1.0, which it only is once Overview has settled
- hidden when `getTaskViewCount() == 0`, so it never sits over "No recent items"
- on large screens, revealed only after the state has held briefly (see below)

That last one exists because Overview is entered and abandoned for a few frames during
some gestures, and in those frames *every* readable value — scale, content alpha, view
visibility, the whole alpha chain, even the stock button's own alpha and position — is
identical to a real Overview session. Nothing distinguishes them at an instant, so the
module waits instead.

## Settings

Both are plain `Settings.System` keys, read live — no reinstall, no launcher restart.

```sh
# how long the state must hold before the button appears, large screens only.
# Default 200. Lower feels snappier; too low and it flickers during gestures.
settings put system clear_all_reveal_delay_ms 200

# horizontal placement of the floating variant, large screens only.
# 0 = end (default), 1 = start, 2 = centre
settings put system clear_all_button_gravity 0
```

## Compatibility

- Pixel Launcher (`com.google.android.apps.nexuslauncher`)
- Developed and tested on Android 16 on a Pixel Fold, on both panels
- Requires an Xposed framework — LSPosed, or a maintained fork such as Vector

It resolves the launcher's classes, methods and resources **by name** at runtime and copies
its styling from live views, so it carries no hardcoded ids, colours or dimensions and
should survive launcher updates that do not rename
`com.android.quickstep.views.RecentsView` / `OverviewActionsView`.

## Building

`build.sh` takes its toolchain from the environment:

```sh
AJ=/path/to/android.jar \
XP=/path/to/xposed-api-82.jar \
BT=/path/to/build-tools \
KS=/path/to/keystore.jks KS_PASS=... \
./build.sh
```

The Xposed API jar is `de.robv.android.xposed:api:82`, available from
`https://api.xposed.info/`. Note that `classes.dex` is added **stored, not deflated** —
Android mmaps the dex straight out of the APK.

## Licence

GPL-3.0, matching [PixelXpert](https://github.com/Codecity001/PixelXpert), whose
`ClearAllButtonMod` this follows.

## Credit

The approach follows [PixelXpert](https://github.com/Codecity001/PixelXpert)'s
`ClearAllButtonMod`, which worked out the two load-bearing details: `OverviewActionsView`
is `WRAP_CONTENT`, so a child added to it falls outside the touchable area unless the
parent is resized; and the `MultiValueAlpha` that fades the actions bar is attached to the
inner row rather than the root, so a child of the root never gets hidden.
